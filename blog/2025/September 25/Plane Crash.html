    <h1>Plane Crash</h1>
    <pre>
We all have a plane crash.
The one that took our mother or a limb,
a husband, solace, or sanity.

What is yours?
What plagues you?
Wakes you up in the middle of a dry meeting
or a cold night?

We all have a moment when the world
fails to hold us up,
a sudden silence in the cabin,
a gasp, a drop, a memory.

But we also have rescueâ€”
small, everyday mercies
like ice cream on a hot afternoon,
or a poem that lands softly
when we need it most.   [Your poem content goes here!]
